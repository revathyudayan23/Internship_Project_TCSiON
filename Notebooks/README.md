This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for the project. The notebooks are structured as follows:

EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA.ipynb)

Analyzes the dataset to understand patterns and distributions.
Includes visualizations of drug reviews, user ratings, and feature correlations.
Identifies missing values, outliers, and feature importance.

Approach 1 - Text Features (text_features.ipynb)

Uses text-based features (drug reviews) for classification.
Implements NLP techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Explores models like Naive Bayes.

Approach 2 - Numerical Features (numerical_features.ipynb)

Uses structured numerical data (ratings, conditions, etc.) for classification.
Explores ML models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
The best model achieved 86.2% accuracy using Logistic Regression.
