# Conclusion

As I conclude this project I was able to approach the problem assigned tome in two different way and build models two different ways. As the second approach which considered only the numerical columns gave more than 80 percent accuracy in three different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest that approach can be considered more convenient and effective in building further applications. Of all three models Logistic regression gave the maximum accuracy in the second approach and can be considered as the best model.
To sum up trying out different approaches and fitting different models helped me understand more about the topic and overall this internship become first step towards the career as a Data Analyst.
