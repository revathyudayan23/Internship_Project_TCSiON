# Internship Project - TCS iON

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **classifying drug reviews based on user satisfaction and side effects** using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from WebMD, contains user reviews, effectiveness ratings, ease of use, and other attributes related to various drugs.  

The project explores **two different approaches**:  
1️⃣ **Text-Based Approach** – Uses NLP techniques to analyze drug reviews and predict satisfaction levels.  
2️⃣ **Numerical Feature-Based Approach** – Uses structured data (ratings, effectiveness, and ease of use) to classify user experience.  

The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **modeling** using algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees**. The best-performing model achieved **86.2% accuracy** in predicting user satisfaction.
