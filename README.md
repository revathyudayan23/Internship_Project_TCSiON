# Internship Project - TCS iON

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of my internship at TCS iON. The objective of this project is to "Build a Calssification model to classify drugs based on their side effects. The project involves data preprocessing, analysis, visualization and model fitting  using Python."

The project explores **two different approaches**:  
1️⃣ **Text-Based Approach** – Uses NLP techniques to analyze drug reviews and predict satisfaction levels.  
2️⃣ **Numerical Feature-Based Approach** – Uses structured data (ratings, effectiveness, and ease of use) to classify user experience.  

The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **modeling** using algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees**. The best-performing model achieved **86.2% accuracy** in predicting user satisfaction.  

🛠 Technologies Used
