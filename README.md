# Internship_Project_TCSiON
Drug Side Effects Classification using Machine Learning | Internship Project at TCS iON | Explored text-based and numerical feature approaches to predict drug satisfaction and side effects.

# Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify drugs based on their side effects and user satisfaction. With increasing drug consumption, understanding potential side effects can help users make informed decisions.

Two different approaches were explored using the WebMD Drug Review Dataset:
1️⃣ First Approach → Using text-based features (Reviews) and satisfaction as the target variable.
2️⃣ Second Approach → Using only numerical features for classification.
The best-performing model was Logistic Regression in the second approach, achieving 86.2% accuracy.
