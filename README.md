# Internship Project - TCS iON

## 📌 Project Overview  
 
This project was completed as part of my internship at TCS iON (2022) . The objective of this project is to build a Calssification model to classify drugs based on their side effects.
Project Title: Classification Model - Build a Model that classifies the side effects of a drug.

Key Features & Analysis:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and formatted data.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for insights.
✅ Machine Learning (if applicable): Built models using Scikit-learn.
✅ Data Visualization: Created visual reports for insights.

The project explores **two different approaches**:  
1️⃣ **Text-Based Approach** – Uses NLP techniques to analyze drug reviews and predict satisfaction levels.  
2️⃣ **Numerical Feature-Based Approach** – Uses structured data (ratings, effectiveness, and ease of use) to classify user experience.  
The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **modeling** using algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees**. The best-performing model achieved **86.2% accuracy** in predicting user satisfaction.

🛠 Technologies Used
